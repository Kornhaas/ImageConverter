### Setting Up a Virtual Environment and Installing Requirements

**Windows:**

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - Navigate to your project folder using `cd path\to\your\project` command.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Activate the virtual environment using the command:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Requirements:**
   - Install requirements from a text file (e.g., `requirements.txt`) using pip:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

**macOS:**

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - Open Terminal from the Applications folder or use Spotlight search.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - Navigate to your project folder using `cd /path/to/your/project` command.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Activate the virtual environment using the command:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Requirements:**
   - Install requirements from a text file (e.g., `requirements.txt`) using pip:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### Starting the Application

Once you have activated the virtual environment and installed the requirements, you can start your `app.py` application.

**Windows and macOS:**

1. **Navigate to Your Project Folder:**
   - Use `cd /path/to/your/project` to go to your project folder in the terminal.

2. **Run the Application:**
   - Run your `app.py` application using the appropriate Python command:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

This will start your application within the virtual environment, and you can access it in your web browser or by following any specific instructions provided by your application.

Remember to replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project folder, and ensure that your `requirements.txt` file contains the necessary dependencies for your application.
